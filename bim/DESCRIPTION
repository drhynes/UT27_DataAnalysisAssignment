Description: This package provides tools to analyze rhythmic patterns of immune cell migration, with a focus on T cells in the brain. It aims to identify whether specific immune cell subtypes are predictive of CD8+ T cell dynamics. The package supports analysis of general immune cell rhythms, characterization of their functional profiles, and visualization through customizable plots.
